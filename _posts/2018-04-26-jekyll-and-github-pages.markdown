### Problem
I want a very simple personal site on which I can blog too. It should not require maintenance and should not be costly to host.

### Solution
Use Jekyll with Github pages

### Explanation
The site on which you are reading this post is hosted on Github pages with Jekyll as the static html generator. Jekyll is nothing but a ruby library which converts markdown posts into html content and fills it into the predefined site template. Github pages then allow you to host the content on their sever without any charges. (However getting your own domain name would incur some cost which is typically 600 Indian rupees per year). In case you are unfamiliar with markdown, it is a language which allows you to define text format by using easy pre-defines text characters. Benefit of it is that you donâ€™t need to write html tags. Wiki software uses markdown to write posts.

### How to get started
Head to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and download the node js package and follow the instructions to create a sample project. After becoming comfortable with it, you can create a GitHub account with the name of your personal site. Create an empty repo and dump the project you created with Jekyll. Make sure to run "Jekyll build" to build static web pages.
